1. YOLO model training notebook, model weight is under `./yolo`.

2. Use `Minimap_generator_tryout` to try minimap generate, it uses `minimap_generator.py`

3. Use `ytb_video_download_tryout.ipynb` for video download, it uses `ytb_video_download_script.py`. 
   Useful to download test videos for usage in `YOLO_ByteTrack_Tracker.ipynb`

4. Use `YOLO_ByteTrack_Tracker.ipynb` to use yolo model for detection and tracking. API for JSON output is included.
   (Run the cell in `ytb_video_download_tryout.ipynb` to get a video test case first)

5. Probably need to use pip to download missing modules.
