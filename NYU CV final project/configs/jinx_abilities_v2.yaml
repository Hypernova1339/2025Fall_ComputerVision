# YOLO Dataset Configuration for Jinx Ability Detection - V2 (8 Classes)
# Expanded to include both UI ability bar detection and world VFX detection
# Used by Ultralytics YOLOv8 for training and validation

# Dataset paths (relative to this config file location)
path: ../data
train: images/train
val: images/val

# 8-Class Detection System
# --------------------------
# Classes 0-3: UI Ability Bar (fixed position, cooldown indicators)
# Classes 4-7: World VFX (projectiles and impacts anywhere on screen)

names:
  # UI Ability Bar Detection (fixed screen position)
  # These detect the ability icons' state in the HUD
  0: UI_W_READY       # W icon available (bright/colorful)
  1: UI_W_COOLDOWN    # W icon on cooldown (grayed out with timer)
  2: UI_R_READY       # R icon available (bright/colorful)
  3: UI_R_COOLDOWN    # R icon on cooldown (grayed out with timer)
  
  # World VFX Detection (anywhere on screen)
  # These detect the actual ability effects in the game world
  4: VFX_W_PROJECTILE # Zap! laser beam in flight
  5: VFX_W_IMPACT     # Zap! hit effect (electric spark)
  6: VFX_R_ROCKET     # Super Mega Death Rocket projectile
  7: VFX_R_IMPACT     # Rocket explosion effect

# =============================================================================
# CLASS DESCRIPTIONS
# =============================================================================
#
# UI_W_READY (0):
#   - W ability icon in the ability bar when available
#   - Appears bright/colorful (blue-ish for Jinx W)
#   - Located at fixed screen position (bottom center)
#   - Small bounding box around the icon
#
# UI_W_COOLDOWN (1):
#   - W ability icon when on cooldown
#   - Appears grayed out with cooldown number overlay
#   - Same position as UI_W_READY
#   - Transition from READY to COOLDOWN = ability was cast
#
# UI_R_READY (2):
#   - R (ultimate) ability icon when available
#   - Appears bright/colorful
#   - To the right of W icon in ability bar
#
# UI_R_COOLDOWN (3):
#   - R ability icon when on cooldown
#   - Grayed out with cooldown timer
#   - R cooldowns are longer (90-120+ seconds at rank 1)
#
# VFX_W_PROJECTILE (4):
#   - The Zap! (W) laser beam traveling through the air
#   - Long, narrow, electric/energy appearance
#   - Moves fast but visible for ~0.5-1.5 seconds
#   - Draw elongated bounding box around the beam
#
# VFX_W_IMPACT (5):
#   - The hit effect when Zap! connects with a target
#   - Electric spark/stun visual
#   - Appears briefly at point of contact
#   - Relatively small bounding box
#
# VFX_R_ROCKET (6):
#   - The Super Mega Death Rocket projectile
#   - Large missile that grows as it travels
#   - Can be visible for 0.5-8+ seconds (global ult)
#   - Draw box around rocket body (not trail)
#
# VFX_R_IMPACT (7):
#   - The explosion when the rocket hits
#   - Large, bright explosion effect
#   - Draw box around entire explosion area
#
# =============================================================================
# LABELING STRATEGY
# =============================================================================
#
# Option A: UI-only training (simpler)
#   - Only label classes 0-3 (UI icons)
#   - Faster to label (fixed positions)
#   - Useful for auto-detecting cast times
#
# Option B: VFX-only training (original approach)
#   - Only label classes 4-7 (world VFX)
#   - More complex but directly detects abilities
#
# Option C: Combined training (recommended)
#   - Label all 8 classes
#   - UI detection provides cast timing
#   - VFX detection confirms ability in game world
#   - Most robust but requires more labeling
#

# DETECTION PIPELINE
# =============================================================================
#
# Frame → [UI Detection] → Detect state changes (READY → COOLDOWN)
#                       ↓
#                 Cast timestamp logged
#                       ↓
#      → [VFX Detection] → Detect projectile/impact
#                       ↓
#                 Confirm cast, detect hit/miss
